The Department of Community Health will mail a Medicaid card for each
person approved for Medical Assistance unless you are approved for a
type of Medicaid that only pays for Medicare premiums. If this is a
notice to extend your current benefits you will not receive a new
Medicaid card. Your current card will still be valid for use. If you
have not gotten your Medicaid card within a week of this notice, you
lose your card, or you have questions about how to use Medicaid, please
call 1-866-211-0950 or go to our website at
*http://www.mmis.georgia.gov[www.mmis.georgia.gov].*

Some Medical Assistance members are assigned to a Care Management
Organization (CMO) upon approval for coverage.  If this is true for any
member of your household, you will be notified by Georgia Families (GF)
by mail or phone regarding to which CMO the member(s) is assigned.  You
may select a different CMO during the first 90 days of enrollment and
Georgia Families can  assist you with a selection if you request it. 
The Georgia Families website is
http://www.georgia-families.com[www.georgia-families.com] and the phone
number is 1-888-GA-Enroll (1-888-423-6765).  You will get a CMO card
from the CMO you are assigned to or choose.  Please keep both your
Medicaid and your CMO cards with you when you schedule appointments to
visit your doctor. Your doctor needs the numbers on your cards to
schedule your appointment and see you.

*Medical Assistance – Express Lane Eligibility (ELE) Opt Out Statement*

*You may qualify for Medicaid or PeachCare for Kids® coverage through
Express Lane Eligibility (ELE).* ELE is the automatic enrollment of
children under the age of 19 who are receiving Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF), Child Care and Parent Services (CAPS) or Women, Infants and
Children (WIC) into the Medical Assistance program.  DFCS will use the
information you provided to help enroll or renew your children in
Medicaid or PeachCare for Kids®. If your children are eligible for
PeachCare for Kids®, they may be subject to a premium. DFCS will send
you a determination notice, let you make any changes, and allow you to
opt out at any time.

If you would like to opt out of the ELE process or to terminate the
Medical Assistance case for your children, you can call the DFCS call
center at 1-877-423-4746 or complete the corresponding [.underline]#opt
